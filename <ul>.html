        <b>Stock trading platform API:</b> Used an object-oriented approach to design an API to log stock market
        transactions
        with a focus on using an efficient data structure. Designed methods to supplement the operations of searching
        and sorting the transactions by different parameters.

    <li>
        <b>Algorithmic Efficiency Analyzer:</b> Studied and implemented searching, sorting, pathfinding, and string algorithms
        and
        developed a program to perform the experimental analysis of those algorithms using python. Used Python’s
        Matplotlib
        library to visualize the performance for datasets of different sizes.
